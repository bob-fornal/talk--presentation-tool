Feature: The Pitfalls and Promise of Gherkin in Automated Testing

  Background:
    Given Gherkin is a domain-specific language used for behavior-driven development (BDD)
    And it is intended to bridge communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders

  Scenario: Understanding the dual nature of Gherkin in development
    Given Gherkin uses structured keywords such as "Feature", "Scenario", "Given", "When", "Then", "And", and "But"
    When it is used well, it enhances communication and collaboration
    Then it improves the readability and understanding of software specifications

  Scenario: Identifying potential pitfalls of Gherkin
    Given some implementations of Gherkin can sabotage the development process
    When there are unclear feature descriptions
    And scenarios become overly complex
    And there is misalignment between tests and actual business requirements
    Then Gherkin can hinder automated testing and development progress

  Scenario: Using Gherkin properly
    Given there are common mistakes in implementing Gherkin
    When strategies are put in place to mitigate issues
    Then Gherkin can be used effectively to support and enhance testing processes
    And development efforts can become more efficient

  Scenario: Gaining practical insights into Gherkin usage
    Given attendees are seeking practical tips for using Gherkin
    When they are provided with recommended practices for optimizing Gherkin
    Then they can ensure Gherkin is a powerful tool to aid in the development process
