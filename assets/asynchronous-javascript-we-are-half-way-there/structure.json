    "notes": "What we want to do throughout this talk is look at how these patterns are created and used.<br/><br/>Based on this deeper understanding, we can think more logically about the patterns we are creating and using.<br/><br/>I equate this to the difference between a driver, a driver that can change the oil, and a mechanic. Each has an understanding of how a car works, but the mechanic has a depth of understanding that allows him to do much more with a vehicle."
